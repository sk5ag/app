ABOUT THIS NODE.JS EXAMPLE: This example works with AWS SDK for JavaScript version 3 (v3),
which is available at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3. This example follows the steps in "Getting started with Amazon S3" in the Amazon S3
User Guide.
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html

Purpose:
Shows how to use the AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3) to get started using Amazon Simple Storage
Service (Amazon S3). Create a bucket, move objects into and out of it, and delete all
resources at the end of the demo.

Inputs (in command line):
node s3_basics.js <the bucket name> <the AWS Region to use> <object name> <object content>

Running the code:
node s3_basics.js
